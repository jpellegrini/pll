# PLL: Programming in Logic in Lisp

PLL is a simple Prolog in Scheme, developed as a teaching 
aid. It is supposed to make it easy to understand the execution 
model of Prolog, including variables, cuts, and meta-predicates. 
There is also a simple FFI to Scheme.

When I say "simple", I really mean it. This implementation is 
NOT efficient at all, and it misses several features. The manual 
is also very basic, although it covers most of what really matters.

The code is documented, but not "densely documented" -- this
is mostly because the interpreter was developed as an auxiliary 
tool for a course, and the implementation details are explained in
the course notes which were written in Portuguese.
However, the code may be used as a companion to chapter 4
of Sterling and Shapiro's "The Art of Prolog", as it closely follows
the execution model explained there.

## LOADING PLL


There are two ways to use PLL. In implementations that support R7RS,
you can import it. This may be useful if you want to rename identifiers.
In implementations that do not support R7RS, there is a file that will
load the interpreter.

```
(load "pll-standalone.scm")    ;; this works on all supported schemes.

(import (pll))                 ;; only on the systems marked as having
                               ;; support for R7RS modules
```

## VARIABLES

Traditionally, Prolog systems treat symbols beginning
with uppercase letters as variables: X, Y, Variable are
variables, while x, y, constant are constants.

Lisp-based Prologs usually do this differently: the variables
are the symbols that begin with a question mark: `?x`, `?y`,
`?variable`, etc. We do the same in this implementation.


## CALLING THE INTERPRETER


Our Prolog use the following syntax:

```
(pure-prolog PROGRAM GOAL)
```

The program is a list of assertions. The program

```
         p(x).
         p(Z) :- q, r(Z).
```
	 
is written as a list of assertions. Each assertion is a list
where the head represents the left side (the consequent), and
the tail is a list of the goals to be met in order to prove
the consequent. For example,

```
        '(( (p x) ))
          ( (p ?z) q (r ?z)))
```

The GOAL is a list of goals:

```
        p(1), q(X).
```

is written as

```
        '((p 1) (q ?x))
```

EXAMPLE: Suppose we want to enter the following program:

```
f(0).
f(Z) :- g(Z).
h(3).
h(4).
p(Z,Y,S) :- f(Z),g(Y),h(S)
g(10).
```

And ask the question

```
p(10,D,A), q(A).
```

We can do this:

```
(define facts '(( (f 0) )
                ( (f ?z) (g ?z) )
                ( (h 3) )
                ( (h 4) )
                ( (q 4) )
                ( (p ?z ?y ?s) (f ?z) (g ?y) (h ?s) )
                ( (g 10) )))
(define goals '((p 10 ?d ?a) (q ?a)))
```

And call

```
(pure-prolog facts goals)
```

Or, directly enter the facts and goal (as we do in the examples
that are included in `prolog-examples.scm`):

```
(pure-prolog '(( (f 0) )
               ( (f ?z) (g ?z))
               ( (h 3) )
               ( (h 4) )
               ( (q 4) )
               ( (p ?z ?y ?s) (f ?z) (g ?y) (h ?s))
               ( (g 10) ))
             '((p 10 ?d ?a) (q ?a)))
```

The result will be a list of substitutions that satisfy
the goal:

```
((?a . 4) (?d . 10))
```

GETTING MULTIPLE ANSWERS
------------------------

This can be done with the `amb+` operator.

```
(pure-prolog '(((f 1))
               ((f 2)))
             '((f ?x)))

((?x 1))
```

If we call `(amb+)`, then we get another solution:

```
((?x 2))
```


## DIFFERENT INTERPRETERS

The different interpreters included are:

- `pure prolog`      (prolog only)
- `prolog+built-ins` (with built-in predicates with side-effect)
- `prolog+scheme`    (with an FFI to Scheme, but NO built-ins)
- `prolog+local`     (with "IS" and local vars; on top of prolog+scheme)
- `prolog+meta`      (with assert and retract; on top of prolog+local)
- `prolog+cut`       (with cut (!); on top of prolog+meta)

So the features are added one on top of the other, except for the
built-ins feature, which is not included in the later interpreters.

In the source code, there is one initial implementation (pure-prolog)
with short comments explaining how it works. Each interpreter after
that one has comments only on the modified parts.


### Pure Prolog


This is the most basic of all. You can only statet facts as
we described above, nothing else. Call it as

```
(pure-prolog facts goals)
```

For example, we define a graph by declaring its edges, then
define a `reach/2` predicate.

```
edge(a,b).
edge(a,c).
edge(c,b).
edge(c,d).
edge(d,e).
reach(A,B) :- edge(A,B).
reach(A,B) :- edge(A,X), reach(X,B).
```

We could then as "`reach(b,e)`" and find that *b* doesn't reach
*e*.

In PLL:

```
(define graph '( ((edge a b))
                 ((edge a c))
                 ((edge c b))
                 ((edge c d))
                 ((edge d e))
                 ((reach ?a ?b) (edge ?a ?b))
                 ((reach ?a ?b) (edge ?a ?x)
                                (reach ?x ?b))))

(pure-prolog graph '( (reach b e) ))
#f
```

### Prolog with built-in "procedures"

This adds some predicates with side-effects.

Define a list of Scheme functions that you want to be
accessible from Prolog:

```
(define write-it
  (lambda (args sub)
    (cond ((not (null? args))
           (if (matching-symbol? (car args))
               (display (assoc (car args) sub))
               (display (car args)))
           (write-it (cdr args) sub))
          (else #t))))
```

Here "`sub`" is the current substitution, where Prolog will find
the values of variables.

```	  
(define built-ins `((write . ,write-it)))
```

So `(write a b c ...)` will be translated to

```
(write-it (a b c ...) sub)
```

Then, whenever one of these predicates show up in the
goal, Prolog will execute them:

```
father(john,johnny).
father(old-john,john).
grandpa(A,B) :- father(A,X), father(X,B).
```

Our goal is

```
grandpa(old-john,Who), write("grandson is: "), write(Who).
```

In our Prolog, this is expressed as follows:

```
(prolog+built-ins '( ((father john johnny))
                     ((father old-john john))
                     ((grandpa ?a ?b) (father ?a ?x) (father ?x ?b)) )
                  '( (grandpa old-john ?who)  (write "Grandson is: " ?who) ))

Grandson is: johnny
(((?who . johnny)) ())
```

The first line was the effect of having a `(write ...)` in the goal.
The second is the answer.

The built-ins `load` and `save` can be used to save and restore the list of built-ins
from a file (but not the *definitions* of these built-ins).


### Prolog with any scheme function

This interpreter has no sandbox -- it will recognize and execute
any Scheme function when it sees one.

Suppose we want to run this Prolog program, and use a Scheme
function "`print`" in the goal:

```
a(5).
b(3).
b(5).
```

Goal:
```
a(X), b(Y), X=Y, print(X, " " Y).
```

In our Prolog, we have:

```
(prolog+scheme '( ((a 5))
                  ((b 3))
                  ((b 5)))
               '( (a ?x) (b ?y) ((= ?x ?y)) ((print ?x " " ?y))))

5 5
((?y . 5) (?x . 5))
```

The first line is the effect of the print. The second line is
Prolog's answer.

### With local variables

```
(prolog+local '( ((f ?x ?y)
                  (is ?y (* 2 ?x))
                  ((print 'OK: ?y))))
              '( (f 3 ?a) ))

OK:6
((?a . 6))
```

### With assert and retract

This adds the meta-predicates `assert` and `retract`.

```
(prolog+meta '(( (f ?x) (asserta (h 1)))
               ( (g ?x) (h ?x)))
             '((f ?w) (g ?z)))
```

The result will be `((?z . 1))`


`retract` has the opposite effect. The Prolog program we show now is

```
f(2).
f(3).
g(1) :- retract(f(2)).
```

And the goal is

```
g(1), f(X).
```

In PPL's Schemish-Prolog, this is

```
(define prolog-retract '( ((f 2))
                          ((f 3))
                          ((g 1) (retract ((f 2))))
                          ((g 1) (f 3))))
(prolog+meta prolog-retract '((g 1) (f ?x)))
```

`(g 1)` causes retract to be evaluated, so the goal succeeds
with *X=3*, and not *X=2*:

```
((?x 3))
```

### With cut

This adds the cut operator. For example, in Prolog we could write

```
a(X) :- b(X), !, c(X).
b(1).
b(2).
c(2).
```

The goal `a(X)` fails, because after the interpreter chooses `b(1)`,
it cannot backtrack, and `c(1)` is not true.

In our Prolog, we write:

```
(prolog+cut '(( (a ?x) (b ?x) ! (c ?x) )
              ( (b 1) )
              ( (b 2) )
              ( (c 2) ))
            '((a ?x)))

#f
```

If we remove the cut, then this goal will succeed with *X=2*.

The cut can be used also in the goal.


## BUGS AND MISSING FEATURES


* There is no way to save and load the database (but there is a way to save
  and load built-ins)

* There is no simple way to get all possible answers (substitutions) for a
  query in a list.
